# 🧠 DSA Repository  

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms** practice repo — where I document my daily problem-solving journey across platforms like **LeetCode** and **GeeksforGeeks**.  

This isn’t just a repo of solutions — it’s a logbook of how I *think*, *debug*, and *improve* one question at a time.  
From brute force to optimal, from confusion to clarity — every problem here tells a story of progress. 🚀
